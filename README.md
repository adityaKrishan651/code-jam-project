# Student Kit

We made a simple application Desktop that consists of some of the basic necessities of a student that are:

 - A todo list

 - Maintaining notes

 - Marking events on the calendar

 - Saving up important document and files

    

    All combined in a simple application.

    Hope you like it :)

## How To Run (READ THIS)

`$ pip3 install requirements.txt`

`$ python3 app.py`

we have made this application using flask web gui, it can only run if you have chrome on your machine as a default browser else there might be some running issues sometime if you don't have chrome as you default browser it might run but you need to have chrome, if for some reason you don't have chrome than you need to go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 on your web browser and there you can intract with the application
