# Student Kit

We made a simple application that consists of some of the basic necessities of a student that are:

 - A todo list

 - Maintaining notes

 - Marking events on the calendar

 - Saving up important document and files

    

    All combined in a simple application.

    Hope you like it :)

## How To Run

`$ pip3 install requirements.txt`

### If Chrome is your default browser
if chrome is your default browser then a desktop window will pop up when you run `app.py` but still if the window does not pops up go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 on chrome

### If Chrome is not your default browser
if chrome is not your default browser then you will need to go to  http://127.0.0.1:5000 on your web browser but still you can wait for a minute or so for the window to come up
